> Interswitch's official laravel package to easily integrate to Quickteller Business to collect payments.
To begin, create an account at https://business.quickteller.com if you haven't already.

## Installation

[PHP](https://php.net) 7.2+ and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) are required.

To get the latest version of Laravel Interswitch, simply require it

```bash
composer require interswitch/laravel-interswitch
```
Once installed, the package automatically registers its service provider and facade.


## Configuration
You can publish the configuration file using this command:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Interswitch\Interswitch\InterswitchServiceProvider"
```
A configuration file 'interswitch.php' with some defaults is placed in your config directory.


## Payment Flow
The payment flow is described below:

1. User clicks a button to make payment, the user is redirected to the payment page, usually by submitting a form with hidden fields.
2. On the payment page, there are multiple payment options:
- **Card Option:** The user enters card details and follows the prompt.
- **Transfer(Virtual Accounts) Option:** The user can pay via a bank transfer either using their financial/bank app or USSD to the dynamic account number displayed to complete the transaction.
- **QR Option:** The user can scan the QR displayed on the payment page using their bank app to complete the transaction.
- **USSD Option:** 
    - The user selects a bank
    - A USSD code is generated 
    - User types the USSD code on their mobile device and follows the prompt. 
- **Verve Wallet:** The user can login to their verve wallet if they have one.
3. The user gets a prompt indicating a successful or a failed transaction.

## Usage

### Environments
Quickteller Business provides a test and a live environment.  
The test environment allows you to test your integration without actually charging any bank account.  
After successfully testing your integration, you can easily switch to the live environment (after all required documents have been uploaded).  

For the test environment, in your .env file, add:
```php
INTERSWITCH_ENV=TEST
```
For the live environment, in your .env file, add:
```php
INTERSWITCH_ENV=LIVE
```
If none is present, the test environment is assummed by default.

Furthermore, you need to add the following environment variables:
```php
INTERSWITCH_REDIRECT_URL=
INTERSWITCH_PAY_ITEM_ID= 
INTERSWITCH_MERCHANT_CODE= 
```
The **INTERSWITCH_REDIRECT_URL** is the endpoint you will like to get the status of a transaction.
Also define this route in your route file and make a call to **confirmTransaction()** like so:

```php
use Interswitch\Interswitch\Facades\Interswitch;

...

Interswitch::confirmTransaction();
```


To get your **INTERSWITCH_PAY_ITEM_ID** and **INTERSWITCH_MERCHANT_CODE**,

#### - Further Steps: ####
- Click the 'Pay Now' button and follow the required steps. 
- Note that the form is submitted to the route 'interswitch-pay', this is predefined in the package.
- On clicking the 'Pay Now' button, the user is redirected to interswitch's payment page. Choose a payment option and follow the steps. 
- The user is then redirected back to your website as indicated by 'INTERSWITCH_REDIRECT_URL'.
- This url will return the result of the transaction. Sample response will be like so:
```php
{
"transactionReference": "y84KWu1617176725",
"responseCode": "00",
"responseDescription": "Approved by Financial Institution",
"paymentReference": "FBN|WEB|MX26070|31-03-2021|3511400|927085",
"returnedReference": "1287984345",
"cardNumber": "",
"approvedAmount": "15000",
"amount": "15000",
"mac": ""
}
```
#### Note: #### 
- **Please ensure APP_URL is correctly defined. A wrong value will result in unexpected behaviour.**

 https://developer.interswitch.com/docs/quickteller-business/web-integrations/#test-cards


#### - Handling the Response ####
For integrity purpose, you need to make a server side request to get the final status of a transaction before giving value.
To do this, make a call to **confirmTransaction(transactionReference, amount)** like so:

```php
use Interswitch\Interswitch\Facades\Interswitch;

...

Interswitch::confirmTransaction(transactionReference, amount);
```

It returns a JSON object containing the status of the transaction.
Consider the sample response below: 

```php
{
"paymentReference": "FBN|WEB|MX26070|31-03-2021|3511400|927085",
"responseCode": "00",
"responseDescription": "Approved by Financial Institution",
"amount": "15000",
"transactionDate": "2021-03-31T08:45:31",
"merchantReference": "y84KWu1617176725"
}
```
Below is a description of the response keys:
| Key                      | Meaning                                                               |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| responseCode         | A code indicating the status of the transaction.                      |
